# Final-Exam-Cailey-Baron-

For this final exam, we were tasked with choosing our own data set, and then making a dashboard and completing analysis on 5 different variables across at least 3 kinds of statistical models. This assignment requires completing the full data analysis process: data preprocessing, creating and interpreting visualizations, and predictive modeling. The goal is to move from raw data to meaningful insights by cleaning the data, exploring important relationships, and building models that can generate predictions from patterns.

For this project, I selected a publicly available dataset of worldwide UFO sightings containing over 88,000 observations. The data include both categorical and numerical variables such as reported location, event date, description, latitude/longitude, time of day, and reported duration of the sighting. Because the dataset required several cleaning steps including handling missing values, recoding variables, and merging geographic information to create useful maps, it satisfies the requirements for data cleaning and also provides us with interesting information that otherwise would not have been known.

In this analysis, I focus on predicting the duration of UFO sightings using predictors like year, season, latitude, longitude, and time of day. Through dashboards and performance comparisons across multiple statistical models, I investigate whether these factors help us to explain how long UFO sightings last. This project also evaluates which predictive methods perform best and what these predictions tell us about UFO reports.
